		"description1":"My colleague, Savannah Julian, and I developed this website for Alissa at Divine Pie in Portland, OR as the company transitioned into a new branding. The site is a one-page scrolling page with a sticky navigation/title bar, a direct Facebook feed, a java-script comment carousel, jquery scrollTo navigation, and a customized Google map. Also the implementing of Sass with Compass to organize and generate your stylesheets kept things in harmony as we took this site from the ground up.",
